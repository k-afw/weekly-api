This initial surge of energy is not a call to action, but a moment of profound gratitude. As the seasons turn and spring unfolds, the cosmos urges you to soften your powerful roar into a gentle hum. This period is for savoring simple joys—the warmth of a conversation, the beauty of a garden, the comfort of family. Your fiery spirit is asked to find its hearth. A deep valley of quietude arrives in **April**, a cosmic invitation to conserve your energy and resources. Resist any urge to push forward; this is a time for stillness and allowing others to take the lead. This first half of the year is a masterclass in building a foundation of inner peace, a quiet reservoir from which you will draw great strength.",

A period of notable challenge will arrive in **March**, stirring a deep restlessness within you. You may feel a pull between your adventurous Sagittarian spirit and your loyal Dog nature, creating friction. The stars urge caution here: do not let this internal push lead to overexertion or discord. Your primary task is to find balance, prioritizing family harmony and channeling that restless energy into constructive, gentle activity rather than conflict. Navigating this successfully strengthens your foundations, leading to a spring of renewed harmony. The urge to rush may surface again as the season deepens, but you are now wiser. Resist it. Instead, focus on nurturing yourself and your projects from within, allowing for gentle, organic growth. This patience is rewarded as the first half of your year culminates in the radiant energy of **June**.
