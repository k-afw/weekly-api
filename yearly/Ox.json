The initial weeks are a pinnacle of connection, a time when your accumulated experience becomes a beacon for others. You are called to be the elder, the mentor, the steady hand. As winter's chill gives way to the gentle promise of spring, this energy shifts from outward guidance to inward cultivation. The focus turns to the simple, foundational joys: nurturing family bonds, tending to your own wellbeing, and finding solace in familiar routines. This is a period for embracing a slower, more deliberate pace. In matters of the heart, this means being generous with your time and attention, especially with younger generations who cherish your stories. Financially, your legacy is not in accumulation but in thoughtful distribution; consider supporting a cause you believe in, as your generosity creates ripples of good. You are building a season of serene stability, one rooted in gratitude and connection.",
