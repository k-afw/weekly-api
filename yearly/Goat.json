The initial months call you to the quiet library of your own mind, urging you to reflect on the legacy you've built and the wisdom you hold. This is a time for reconnecting with family, not through grand events, but through shared stories and the simple comfort of presence. The celestial energies encourage you to find joy in cozy comforts and cherished connections, reinforcing the foundations of your emotional world. However, the stars signal a necessary turning point as winter gives way to spring. In **March**, you will feel a profound pull inward, a deep valley of quiet contemplation. Do not resist this; it is a vital period for shedding old anxieties and finding a core of unshakable inner peace. Financially, this first half of the year favors simplicity and security over risk; review your plans to ensure they bring you peace of mind, not stress. Emerging from this deep reflection, you will find the spring blossoms with a renewed sense of purpose, ready to nurture your spirit and your relationships with gentle, golden wisdom.",

The year dawns with a call to integrate the roar of your Leo heart with the gentle wisdom of the Sheep. Your task is to plan meticulously, strengthening both your professional footing and your personal relationships. Ambition will feel potent, but the cosmos urges a grounded approach; this is about building the stage, not just seeking the spotlight. As spring deepens, your creative spirit surges, but a moment of challenge arrives in April. Here, you will be tested.

This is a time for groundwork, for reviewing details, and for fortifying your plans against future storms. By mastering this lesson, you emerge into the later spring with renewed clarity, ready to strategize, adapt, and allow your confidence to bloom on solid ground.",
