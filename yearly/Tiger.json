          "summary": "Greetings, my wise Metal Tiger. Your year begins not with a roar, but with a deep, knowing calm. The initial starlight illuminates your legacy and the lasting love you have cultivated, urging you to set intentions rooted in gratitude. This profound sense of wisdom carries you into the new year, but as winter lingers, you'll find the cosmos calling for inner peace over outer ambition. The universe will present a significant turning point in early spring, particularly around **March**, when a wave of introspection may feel challenging. Do not resist it. This is a crucial period for releasing old anxieties and leaning into the quiet strength of your family bonds. It’s a time to retreat, not to advance. As the world reawakens, so too will your spirit. You’ll find clarity in simplifying your life, perhaps by revisiting finances to create more ease, and rediscovering joy in creative pursuits that ground you in the present moment.",

The early weeks are a powerful time for introspection, urging you to trust your gut instincts on matters of long-term financial security and family bonds. This is your foundation.

The initial energies, particularly around the Lunar New Year, call for a delicate balance between your innate ambition and a newfound need for introspection. This is a time for mending connections, embracing fresh starts within your personal domain, and tending to the roots of your power. True growth requires a stable foundation. Then, as winter gives way to spring, a significant surge arrives. Expect a powerful breakthrough in **March**, a time of roaring success where communication barriers that may have hindered professional or personal partnerships finally dissolve, paving the way for heartfelt progress. As spring deepens, the cosmos asks you to channel this fiery momentum with strategic focus. The period is less about explosive new beginnings and more about nurturing the ventures you've already started. Your leadership is key, but it must be tempered with patience and a willingness to collaborate. By mid-year, the focus shifts to consolidating financial growth through these renewed bonds and strategic partnerships, laying the essential groundwork for the harvest to come.",

          "summary": "Ah, my dear Fire Tiger, born under the nurturing moon of Cancer. Your year begins not with a reckless charge, but with a powerful, deliberate stride. The initial months are a time to fortify your den, weaving your fiery ambition into the very fabric of your home and career. Your roar is channeled into clear, honest communication, mending fences and building alliances that provide the security your Cancerian heart craves. You are laying the groundwork for the entire year, ensuring your foundations are unshakeable. As spring deepens, the cosmos calls for a tactical retreat. This is not a sign of weakness, but of wisdom. June, in particular, becomes a quiet valley of reflection. Here, you will pause to assess your finances, listen to the whispers of your intuition, and plant the subtle seeds of your deepest desires. This period of introspection is crucial, for it is in this quiet that you gather the strength for the great hunt to come.",

This isn't just about big dreams; it's about structuring them and connecting with allies who share your vision.\n\nAs winter thaws, your mind buzzes with inspiration. A significant peak arrives around **March**, where your creativity and social circles align beautifully. This is a time to dream big, perhaps about a personal project or a group endeavor. A wise Tiger saves for what they value; consider putting aside a small allowance for a future adventure or a tool that will bring your ideas to life. Through the spring and into early summer, you will explore these new connections, strengthening bonds and balancing your sparkling intellect with necessary moments of rest. Remember, even the most powerful Tiger needs to recharge.\n\nThe year's second act ignites with purpose. **July** supercharges your intellectual pursuits, offering a profound clarity to delve into subjects that truly fascinate you. Embrace this potential, step outside your comfort zone, and trust the sparks of new ideas. This energy builds steadily, leading to the year's most pivotal moment in **October**. This month beckons you to trust your inner compass like never before as the stars align for a grand adventure—a new beginning that requires a leap of faith. Whether in a leadership role at school or a bold personal choice, this is when the Archer's arrow must fly true.\n\nHowever, every hero's journey has its moment of quiet introspection. Following this exhilarating peak, **November** presents a cosmic canvas for a different kind of growth. You may feel your energy dip, a sign not of failure, but of a need to pause and integrate the year's lessons. Resist the urge to push; instead, practice gratitude and allow your creative well to refill. This brief valley is the essential setup for a triumphant final climb. You emerge from this reflective period into a brilliant **December**, a flurry of festive cheer, artistic flair, and deep connection. You will see how the quiet of the previous month fueled this fantastic finale, ending your year on a powerful note of confidence and hard-won accomplishment."
